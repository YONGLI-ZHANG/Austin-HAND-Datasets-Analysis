# Austin-HAND-Datasets-Analysis
1. This project analyzes HAND (Height Above Nearest Drainage) datasets, which can be used to determine flood risk.
2. Two r files created, while hand.r calls grid_func.r, grid.r contains two functions.
3. The major idea is to use contouring algorithm to identify regions with higher risks.
